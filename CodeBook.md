========================================================

This document explain the structure of the three dataset returned for the run_analysis function, before of that, is necessary explain the process of obtain an initial dataset.

# Initial dataset

The initial dataset is the union of the x_train, y_train, subject_train, y_test,subject_test and x_test, finally the names of the subject and the features (features.txt) is loaded and assigned to the union.

# Dataset with mean and standard deviation for each measure

For create a dataset with this characteristics, is necessary create a loop where the names of the variables is split by the character "-", and looking for a word with "mean()" or "std()", the variables resulting for the process are: 

-Length of the dataset with mean and standard deviation for each measure: 66

# Tidy dataset

the tidy dataset contain 563 columns, each row is a record of the mean for each variable classified by subject and activity, the activity is designed to the column called "label".

- Length of the tidy dataset: 68
- Class of subject: Integer
- Class of label: factor, levels (1<-"LAYING",2<-"SITTING",3<-"STANDING",4<-"WALKING",        5<-,"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", 6<- "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"  )
- Class of the variables: numeric
